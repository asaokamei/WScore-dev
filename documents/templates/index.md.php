WScore Framework
================

<h3>yet another framework for PHP...</h3>
<p>It's a PHP framework that is simple and small code base. </p>
<p>But it has a unique technology called <a href="cena" >Cena Data Transfer Agent (Cena-DTA)</a>. </p>
<p>Cena-DTA allows to synchronize databases between client and server, or more recently 
known as cloud and application. With Cena DTA, you also can create complex html forms with many 
entities and relations, and reflect the changes into database with 
a very little/simple code. </p>
