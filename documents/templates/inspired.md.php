Inspirations
============

WScore is inspired by many great frameworks and projects. 

Although I believe I never copied codes fom any of them but 
I looked at their code and design whenever I had difficult 
time writing codes. 

###[BEAR.Sunday](https://github.com/koriym/BEAR.Sunday)

I learned everything about OOP from BEAR.Sunday.

It is the resource oriented framework, the future of PHP framework.


###[Aura Framework](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Framework)

I believe it has the most beautiful and concentrated codes among popular 
PHP framework I have looked at. (Laravel maybe another one). 

Whenever I had to look up for some implementations and designs, 
I looked into Aura framework.


###[Symfony](http://symfony.com/)

It is becoming the de-fact standard framework for PHP... at least it is 
a leading locomotive for more OO design and standarization in PHP world. 


###[Perfect PHP](http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4774144371)

It is a book about PHP programming published in November 2010 in Japan. 

It had a simple but good working sample for routing, parsing http requests 
(i.e. $_SERVER), etc. to kick-start writing a PHP framework.
