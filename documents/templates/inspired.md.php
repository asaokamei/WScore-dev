Inspirations
============

WScore is inspired by many great frameworks and projects. 

Although I believe I never copied codes fom any of them but 
I looked at their code and design whenever I had difficult 
time writing codes. 

####[BEAR.Sunday](https://github.com/koriym/BEAR.Sunday)

I learned everything about OOP from BEAR.Sunday.

It is the resource oriented framework, the future of PHP framework.


####[Aura Framework](https://github.com/auraphp/Aura.Framework)

I believe it has the most beautiful and concentrated codes among popular 
PHP framework I have looked at. (Laravel maybe another one). 

Whenever I had to look up for some implementations and designs, 
I looked into Aura framework.


####[Symfony](http://symfony.com/)

It is becoming the de-fact standard framework for PHP... at least it is 
a leading locomotive for more OO design and standarization in PHP world. 


####[Perfect PHP](http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4774144371)

It is a book about PHP programming published in November 2010 in Japan. 

It had a simple but good working sample for routing, parsing http requests 
(i.e. $_SERVER), etc. to kick-start writing a PHP framework. 


a little bit history
--------------------

I invented Cena-DTA sometime in 2010.

I was so much excieted that I could not sleep unless, I made it a reality.

[Cena-DTA](https://github.com/asaokamei/Cena-DTA)
: My first try was Cena-DTA framework which is based on ActiveRecord style ORM.
: Although it worked fine and had a good sample of html5 application 
  using local database, I was not happy with the code. I felt it did 
  not have the good structure and difficult to expand. 

[AmidaMVC](https://github.com/asaokamei/AmidaMVC)
: My second framework sort of, is an MVC dispatcher based on Chain of 
  Responsibility pattern. It was while I was working on this framework 
  when I found BEAR.Sunday framework to learn about OOP. 

WScore Framework
: This is the second attempt to implement Cena-DTA. but this time based on 
  data mapper type ORM, like Doctrine 2. 
: I hope this time, I can nail the concept of Cena-DTA right into the code.
